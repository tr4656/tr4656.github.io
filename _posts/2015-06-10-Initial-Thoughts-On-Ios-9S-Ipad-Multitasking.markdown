>The iPad is on the cusp of becoming a completely new computer. This is not an overstatement. Anyone who uses the iPad enough has known for a long time that the device could be capable of a lot more, and iOS 9 is Apple's answer.

I completely agree with Federico Viticci's thoughts on iOS 9. As someone who writes often on the iPad, the new multitasking can be really transformative simply allowing you to copy links and content without having to switch apps. If Apple does the implementation right, the iPad might become a machine with a perfect balance of power and ease of use.
