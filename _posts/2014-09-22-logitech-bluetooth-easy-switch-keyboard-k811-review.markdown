I've been holding off getting a Bluetooth keyboard for quite a while now. Recently though, I've found that I've been using the iPad Mini more and more for more productive tasks (such as writing and sshing into a server) and could really benefit from having an actual keyboard. For me, it still is more convenient to carry around a keyboard and the iPad then even the 2013 Macbook Air, even if it is more powerful. 

Yet, I was hesitant about which one to get simply because of the plethora of options that are available. The Wirecutter does recommend this Logitech but I was skeptical about it. Coming from a mechanical keyboard user, I didn't think spending ~$80 for a rubber dome keyboard was that great of an idea. After looking at many reviews, I was torn between either the cheap [Anker Bluetooth keyboard](http://amzn.com/B005ONMDYE), [Apple Wireless Keyboard](http://amzn.com/B005DLDO4U), or this Logitech. In the end, I decided to splurge on this because of the supposed superior switching between devices, the ease of charging (no AA batteries), and the backlight.

The packaging is farily minimal, containing the just the keyboard and a small case of for the USB cable and the driver CD (which I never touched). The keyboard itself really resembles the keyboard on the Macbook line, if not for the Logitech logo and the black bar on the top. it has the same black and gray color scheme which makes sense since the K811 is the "Mac" version and the K810 is the "Windows" version. There is a power switch for the keyboard on the right side and on the back is a button to make the keyboard discoverable to other devices.

In terms of size, it's about the same thickness as the Nexus 5 and the Macbook Air near thickest point. It's width is about the size of the 13" Macbook Air keyboard, which means it's slightly shorter than the full length of the laptop. It'll be the length of two Nexus 5 or two iPhone 6. 

Typing on the keyboard is fairly good, similar to the feel of the Macbook Air keyboard. It is still scissor keys and has that slightly mushy feel compared to  a mechanical but it's one of the better non-mechanical keyboard's I've used in a while. I do sometimes feel annoyed that you can't prop the keyboard at a bigger angle though, so it feels mostly flat. If you only type on a laptop, you'll feel right at home with the angle though.

The key feature, as Logitech labels it in the name of the product, is the easy switch. The F1, F2, and F3 buttons act as quick toggles to switch between different devices. It's supposed to be easy as you just hit a button and it works. In my experience of using this keyboard for a week, it pretty much is as easy as Logitech says it is.

You hit one of those buttons and the a the wireless icon will shine about it in bright blue. It'll flash if it is trying to connect to a device and will be solid blue once it connects. The light will go away after a few seconds though. As long as you have Bluetooth on your devices, it's as easy as pressing the button and the keyboard will automatically pair with the other device and start working within 5 seconds. While this is the "Mac version", I've had it working with a Windows laptop and my Nexus 5. The only downside with using this keyboard for Windows is that the F keys don't correspond properly to their function and alt + command buttons aren't what they are labeled to be but that is expected. I'm not exactly sure if you really need this feature but I've been using it when I have my Macbook plugged in and have my iPad as well and simply use one keyboard for both devices.

The backlight of this keyboard is fairly  good and resembles the backlit on the Macbook very well. Logitech has implemented a cool feature for it as well, making the backlight only showing up when you type and if you move your hand away, it will slowly dim and lose backlight until you put your hand back. I am slightly annoyed that Logitech hnas made backlight the default option and lose what setting it was previously on if you turn off and then turn on the keyboard but it is a fairly minor annoyance. 

All in all, I am fairly satisfied with this. It was definitely more expensive than the other options but it does what it says very well - switching between different devices easily and quickly. The backlight is also fairly nice, and feels decent to type on. In the end, I do think that it provides more value than both the Anker and the Apple Wireless keyboard and is worth the extra cost tome. Regardless of what I feel about Logitech's other products, Logitech does seem to have their Bluetooth keyboard's right. 


Note: Logitech K760 (which is significantly cheaper) is solar powered and does the same. I just didn't go for it because it was more bulky and heavier, making it less practical for me to carry around. As for the K480, I didn't know about it at the time of purchase.
