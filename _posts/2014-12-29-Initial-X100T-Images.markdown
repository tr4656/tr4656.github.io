This holiday season, I ordered a X100T for myself. It's been a camera I've wanted for a few years now, when I  first found out about the X100. My first impressions are very positive but considering I had it for less than 24 hours, I wouldn't say that I have collected all of my thoughts or had enough use with it yet. 

In spite of that, here are a few images taken with the X100T. 

*Note: Unedited JPGs directly from the camera. Lightroom has some problems with Fuji X-Trans images.*
