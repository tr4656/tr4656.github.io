title: Android And Rss

I've used Android for years now, spanning all the way back to Eclaire  (Android 2.0). I've also been a really big RSS user, using Google Reader  when that was around and then later jumping to [Fever](http://feedafever.com). From then to now though, I don't think I've ever used a great RSS client  on Android. Even now with Android Lollipop, the only real RSS client that supports Fever is [Press](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.twentyfivesquares.press&hl=en) which is alright but lacks  Material Design or even Holo design and actually  fairly buggy considering it hasn't been updated since early 2014. 

For me, this is the problem I have with Android. I like the hardware (sometimes), the OS looks good, but  there just aren't good apps. Yes, RSS is niche and I'm using an even more niche RSS service, but that's just not a problem I have in iOS. Reeder 2 and Unread, both of which are execellent RSS apps that are featureful and well designed, have all supported Fever on iOS. 

The strength of an OS, especially on mobile, is built on the apps. That's why Windows Phone 8, which is great in use, has fundamentally failed. The app marketplace is a graveyard and the power of smartphones are mostly in the apps. That's why I think Android is in an interesting spot right now - in the last few years, the design of Android has drastically improved and even the hardware is a lot better now (just look at the Xperia Z3 Compact, LG G4, and the S6) but app developers need to catch up and create more great apps for Android.
