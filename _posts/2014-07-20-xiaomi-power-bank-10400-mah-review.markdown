For those that are unfamiliar with [Xiaomi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiaomi), they are the Apple of China. It is a Chinese electronics company and started by selling smartphones and a fork of Android called MIUI but has expanded into other consumer electronics and accesories as well. I'm going to review the [Power Bank](http://www.mi.com/en/mipowerbank10400) in this review.

On first impression, the box is really similar to something from Apple. Minimal, clean typography, and white. I'm not really sure what that white line on the front of the box is though.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>

Opening the box, you get another white box.

Opening the small flap reveals a cable and the Power Bank itself.

Even looking at the manual, it appears very Apple. Clean font and (somewhat) minimal.

Looking solely at the battery itself, Xiaomi's claim of using the same aluminum as the Macbook at least seems probable. It looks very similar to how Macbooks look, at least from the outside surface. Like Apple, it tries to be very minimalistic.

Looking at the top, there are LED lights that show how much charge is remaining in the battery itself. LEDs are lit up when you press the giant power button.

Not sure if you can see this, but 2 lights are lit so approximately 50% charge is left. 

It does what its purpose is, an emergency charging battery, fairly well and the cable is pretty fast with Android phones, at least with my Nexus 5.

In terms of just sheer size, its actually not that big, just about the size of an iPhone 3GS.

My main criticism is that while it not that big in terms of height and width, it really is thick. So if you want to put it in your pocket, you have to put something that is thicker than a 3GS in your pocket.

As you can see, the battery is still quite a bit thicker than the 3GS and more than double the width of my Nexus 5. I really don't like putting something that thick in my pocket so it impacts how portable it really is. At 1 inch, it's slightly thicker than the Wirecutter's [best pick](http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-usb-battery-pack-travel/) (by 0.1 inch) while also having 800 mAh less charge. It's not that much larger but it could help. 

The included cable is fairly short so you may need something longer depending on how you plan to charge your device. It also doesn't include Lightning cables so make sure you have your own if you need it to charge iPhones and iPads. 

The capacity is just enough for 1 cycle of iPad Mini Retina and 3 cycles of the Nexus 5, which isn't really a problem for me at all since I will have access to a power port usually just after 1 cycle of charge on my phone.

Other than that, it has been working quite well for the past few days, and while I don't have anything else to compare charging time to, I can charge it with it's cable fairly fast, in ~1 hour using the included cable or the Blackberry Playbook charger (which is the fastest Android charger for me). 

In addition to the power bank, I also got a silicone rubber case for it.

I didn't have a choice in the color or else I would of chosen another color.

It is pretty much just white with one logo on the front. On the back, there is a band but I wasn't sure what you would use it for. I wouldn't trust holding the battery with that and putting the cable there seem like it would just make it more bulky although I suppose it works.

After putting it on, I'm not sure what I feel about it. It does protect the aluminum quite fine but it really hides the beauty of the casing. That's kind of why I don't use any sort of sleeve for the Macbook Air either.

It probably would fit in right next to one of those older white Macbooks but I don't own any of those. Either way, I think I'll keep it on for now since it does protect it and not increase the bulk by too much. Other advantages are that the rubber gives it more grip than the aluminum and protect it from finger prints, which happens with the aluminum similar to the surface of the Macbooks. 

Overall, I do really like the battery as it has really good industrial design (even if it is just borrowed from Apple) and seems to work quite well. It is quite a bit cheaper than the other portable USB batteries if you can buy it in China (69 Yuan which is roughly 11 USD). Make sure you do get the 10400 mAh version though.
