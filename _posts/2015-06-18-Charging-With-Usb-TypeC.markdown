title: Charging With Usb Type-C

During my recent review of the Chrombook Pixel (2015), I mentioned that I wanted to try charging though USB Type-C from another power source other  than the power brick. To do that, I bought a [USB Type-C to USB A 2.0 cable](http://www.monoprice.com/Product?c_id=103&cp_id=10303&cs_id=1030319&p_id=13009&seq=1&format=2) from Monoprice. 

The  main thing I wanted to try is whether it would be able to get a charge for a portable battery pack such as the [Xiaomi Power Bank](http://yifanj.in/2014/07/20/xiaomi-power-bank-10400-mah-review/) and the [Intocircuit Power Bank](https://amzn.com/B00BB5GR0A) that I own.

Luckily, charging with both power backs via the 5.0V/2.1A port works just fine. ChromeOS pops up a "low-power charger" warning but does actually do some charging. I did test with first charging it with the lid closed and in 30 minutes, it charged from 70% to 76% although when I later tested it at a lower battery charge, it was much faster. With the laptop on and in use, connecting the external battery pack meant that the battery level pretty much stayed at the same level even when I watched a 720p videos from YouTube for around 30 minutes.

USB Type-C for me, presents an opportunity for a lot of flexibility. Now instead of just having a battery pack for my  phone, it can also serve as backup battery for the laptop as well in the few cases that the battery is low and a outlet isn't nearby. It also allows for carrying a smaller bag as the  USB C to USB A cable and an iPad style charger would all you need for power instead of carrying the large power brick. Without USB Type-C being a standard and probably being used in phones of the future, it also means that less cables would need to be carried. I'm excited for the USB Type-C future.
