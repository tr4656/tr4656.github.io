I've been interested in fountain pens for almost an year now. Last year, I started with a Lamy Safari and eventually got a Rotring 600, Pilot Parallel, and then the Kaweco AL Sport. I saw the Lamy 2000 online and couldn't help wanting one. The industrial design was very modern and sleek, and it was on [The Pen Addict's Top 5 list](http://www.penaddict.com/top-5-pens/). There was a sale at [Massdrop](https://www.massdrop.com/r/PNZPPC) that was too good to miss so I ordered one.

The packaging of the Lamy is very simple yet elegant <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. The black box is simple but exquite, especially with the magetic top.

The Lamy 2000 itself has a sleek uniboxy. Only the grip and the ink window is really differenciated from the rest of the body. There is a seam in the back for the piston filter but that is nearly invisible. The pen itself feels heavier than the Lamy Safari and the Kaweco AL Sport but is significantly lighter than the Rotring. That probably has to do with the material, as it is mostly (if not all) made of fiberglass. 

The cap of the pen feels pretty much the same as the much of the body in material and feel. When capped, it blends in fairly well with the body. In stays on with a couple of metal hooks that are on the body that are visible when uncapped. There is a clip on the cap that feels very "springy". Regardless, it clips onto things just fine.

The grip of the pen is that silver section near the nib. It feels much like a semi-knurled aluminum section. I say semi-knurled there are verticle lines that allow you hate a good grip onto the pen. It feels comfortable enough to write with, even for extended periods of time. Ideally, I wish the grip would be slighly higher, as I don't hold my pen that close to the tip. Also, since the grip is made of slight vertical grooves, ink tends to get stuck when refilling so you have to clean it afterwards. 

There is a ink window for the Lamy, somewhat above the grip. It becomes the color of the ink when the pen is full. If you can see trhough it, then it needs to be refilled. It works decently, although it really only tells you if it needs to be refilled rather than how much is left. However, it needs to settle for a couple of minutes and much more visible in broad daylight.

The Lamy 2000 is a piston filler so that requires you to use an ink bottle rather than catridge. This is my first piston filler so it was a bit unnerving but turned out to be fairly easy, espeically with the manual. 

This is my first gold nib pen so I was uncertain about how much of an improvement it would be from a steel nib and I have to say, its *fantastic*. Even compared to my Rotring 600, the Lamy 2000 writes much smoother. There are plenty of reports on various fountain websites with the 2000 nibs being hit or miss but mine certainly didn't have any problems.

I bought the extra fine because I tend to write fairly small and found the Safari extra fine to be perfect. It writes slightly thicker than the Safari and is wetter writer. The nib does work well even used at an awkward angle. 

When the pen is loaded with ink, it is a bit top heavy<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. Because of that, I don't write with it posted at all because the center of gravity would be thrown off even more.

I really do see why there is such a following for this pen. It's very modern design has caused it to be placed within the MoMA and writes brillantly as well. As my first >$100 and gold nib fountain pen, I can really see this becoming my main pen because its simply a joy to use. The experience really blew me away.
