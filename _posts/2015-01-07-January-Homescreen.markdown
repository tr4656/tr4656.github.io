I, like many others, reflected upon my past year during the new year just a few days ago. I started to look into my own workflow and among that, I looked at the devices that I use most often - my phone and tablet. As someone who switched from an Android to an iPhone with the release of the iPhone 6, I had to look at whether iOS was a better system for me. That had to start from my homescreen as that is so central to iOS as a whole.

My homescreen on the iPhone mainly are split into 3 categories - Productivity, Social Media, and Utilities. I really use many of the productivity apps very often, especially Launch Center Pro, Workflow, Prompt/Transmit, and Drafts. Workflow is a fairly new app but incredibly useful. It's an automation software, similar to Automator on OS X or Tasker on Android. It is really useful for quickly doing things that would be complicated to do or to repeat something done very often. For example, I have a workflow to do a YouTube to MP3 from a YouTube link in the clipboard and return the MP3 to add to my library. You can also set workflows to be share extension to use in apps or browser, which is incredibly useful. Drafts allow me to quickly write text or note and be able to send that other services or apps and can utilize x-callback ur ls and Javascript. Prompt and Transmit are SSH and FTP clients respectively. Both apps are well designed and are quite useful for quickly uploading an file to a server or running a few commands on a VPS. 

Some of these other apps are also better done than similar Android phones, such as Unread, Overcast, Tweetbot, and Pinner. Unread simply looks better in terms of UI and for readability purposes, which is actually quite important for an RSS client. For podcast clients, I really appreciate Overcast's smart boost features, which removes such of the pauses during podcasts. As someone who listens to a large number of podcats, having a feature that saves me time and allows me to listen to more podcast is great. Pinner is a intuitive Pinboard app and regularly updated, something you just can't find on Android. 

Looking at the apps I use, I don't regret moving to the iPhone. I'm not saying that iOS is perfect or even better than Android. I really do appreciate some features of Android, such as the notifications and the integration with Google services. In fact, I still use a Nexus 5 regularly, just because of some things Android does better than iOS. However, in terms of apps, I truly do feel that iOS apps in many situations are better crafted or simply do not exist on Android. Because of that, I do plan to stick to iOS as my main phone OS.

Most of the apps on my iPad match my iPhone, with a few key differences. I tend to use my iPad for several other purposes, such as photo editing, sketching/drawing, writing, and media consumption. The iPad is an incredibly useful deice for my everyday life, as there are several tasks that I can choose to do on the iPad instead of a laptop, where it would traditionally be done. The iPad is increasingly convenient for quick photo editing, as the X100T has an WiFi function and after that, I can simply use either Flare 2 or Afterlight inside the Photos app, VSCO, or Pixelmator. Procreate is a great app for sketching or drawing with very powerful controls, and watching video on Netflix and Hulu Plus works well as it can be portable. Increasingly, I have also been writing more on the iPad as well, simply pairing it with the [Logitech Easy Switch K811](http://yifanj.in/2014/09/22/logitech-bluetooth-easy-switch-keyboard-k811-review/). I could even do some programming, combining Prompt with vim. 

As for this post, even though it is titled January Homescreen, I'm not really sure whether this will become a monthly post or not. I'm guessing that it'll probably not change often enough for that to happen so I'll see. I'm guessing this will probably end up being something I do every three month or so.
