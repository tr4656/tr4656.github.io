This year, I've decided to do a Project 365, which is a photo-a-day project. I found out about it from a [post on 512Pixels](http://www.512pixels.net/blog/2015/1/project-365-2015). As a combination wanting to improve on my own photography skills, taking more photographs, and getting a new camera, I've started my Project 365.

I'm posting my Project 365 on [Flickr](https://flic.kr/s/aHsk6HpsPv).  Even after a couple of days, I already some difficulty in completing such a project. Just yesterday, I almost forgot to take a photo and finding new subject matters will be hard after a few days. It'll probably become even more of a challenge as I get busier during the year. However, I'm going to try to continue, if simply to just take a break from my work and to pay attention to the world during the day. 

I'll mostly be shooting with the Fujifilm X100T although I have a feeling iPhone shots will be showing for a while when I get busy. There probably will end being a few DSLR shots as well. Regardless, I don't really mind what camera becomes used and many of the photos will be editted. 

I'm looking forward to seeing where this project ends up taking me.
