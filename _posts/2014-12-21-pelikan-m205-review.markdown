Somewhat recently, I got yet another fountain pen - Pelikan M205. I have been interested in this pen for a while now, simply because I haven't used anything from Pelikan just yet and they are more expensive than alternatives. Pen Chalet however, had a deal on one so I couldn't help but get one.

The main outside box of the Pelikan seems fairly simple. The box is plain and is adorned with a Pelikan logo on the top right corner. Inside however, is a much more elegant box, more similar to a gift box.

Opening that box contains the pen

The body of the pen is a classic sleek black with metal rings on the cap. It is a plastic body though, so it is much lighter than the Lamy 2000 I previously reviewed.

Both the cap and the body do get many fingerprints, which may annoy some. For me, I do not really mind since with the black body, it isn't that visible. The other colors that are available may a problem though.

Right underneith the threads, there is an semi-visible area where you can actually see the ink inside if held up to the light. It doesn't show the entire ink capacity though, so it can only really be used for a rough approximation. Having a window can still be useful and it is very cool to see. 

I personally got the Pelikan with a fine nib and the nib looks great when writing. The nib appears much larger than the Lamy as the whole nib is visible. 

Like the Lamy 2000, the M205 is a piston filler. I really like piston filler these days - it is more elegant and more integrated with the pen when compared to using a converter. Pistons tend to store more ink than converters as well.

The M205 has a stainless steel nib. It does write very smooth and is a fairly web writing although not as smooth as the Lamy. For the cost, I am pretty satisfied with the performance of the nib. It writes well at awkward angles and the whole pen has a comfortable weight in hand. As with most fountain pens, I wouldn't use this posted, especially since it would throw off the weight distribution.

The Pelikan M205 is a great pen and I really love mine. As I initally stated, it is more expensive than other stainless steel nibed pens and many of them do perform very similar, such as the TWSBI 580. At full value, I would recommend the TWSBI over the M205 for what you get. If the Pelikan is on sale though, I would wholeheartedly recommend getting one of these to use. I personally think that it is one of my favorite steel nib pen that I've used.
