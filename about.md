This site is just my own personal blog. I have many interests and I want to share my own thoughts on several of these. Lately, I've been doing some reviews on various things.

This blog is made with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and [Poole](http://getpoole.com) and is hosted on Github. It was previously using [Ghost](https://ghost.org/).

I'm probably writing this on a Macbook Air or iPad and taking pictures with a Nikon D7000 using a Nikon 50mm f2.8 or Nikon 18-200mm f/3.5-5.6G.

I'm on twitter at [@tr4656](https://twitter.com/tr4656). Feel free to send me an email at yifan@yifanj.in.
